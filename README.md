# Voice-Assistant
Similar to Jarvis , alexa , cortana , siri , I in my 12th standard final project created this voice assistant named lailaðŸ˜‚. This AI can perform various daily tasks , few of them are listed below.

        it can tell you the current time and date,
        it can tell you the current weather,
        it can tell you battery and cpu usage,
        it can create the reminder list,
        it can take screenshots,
        it can send email to your boss or family or your friend,
        it can shut down or logout or hibernate your system,
        it can tell you non funny jokes, :)
        it can open any website, on chrome web-browser
        it can search the thing on wikipedia,
